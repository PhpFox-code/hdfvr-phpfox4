On a high-speed connection, buffer time will not affect anything because data is sent almost as quickly as it is captured and there is no need to buffer it. On a slow connection, however, there might be a significant difference between how fast Flash Player can capture audio and video data data and how fast it can be sent to the client, thus the surplus needs to be buffered. HDFVR will increase the value specified here as much as possible (if the buffer fills more than 90% of the available buffer, we double the available buffer) to prevent Flash Player from dumping the data in the buffer when it&#039;s full.<\/info>",
